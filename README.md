# Embedded-System

## Course Description

Use of small computers embedded as part of other machines. Limited-resource microcontrollers and state machines from high description language. Embedded hardware: RAM, ROM, flash, timers, UARTs, PWM, A/D, multiplexing, debouncing. Development and debugging tools running on host computers. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) semaphores, mailboxes, queues. Task priorities and rate monotonic scheduling. Software architectures for embedded systems.

## The Compositon of a Computer System
• Hardware – provides basic computing resources(CPU, memory, I/O devices).

• Operating system – controls and coordinates the use of the hardware among the various application programs for the various users.

• Applications programs – define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing problems of the users(compilers,database systems, video games, business programs).

• Users - people, machines, other computers.

• Hardware: processor, memory, I/O, ADC/DAC, power

• Software: Instruction set, firmware, middleware, API
(Application Programming Interface), RTOS, DSP.
